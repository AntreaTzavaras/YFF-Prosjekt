    <p>Greece is known for being one of the most popular tourist destinations 
      in the world- and with good reason! No matter where you go in Greece, 
      you will be surrounded by beauty, history, culture, and nature.</p>

      <h3>Acropolis, Athens</h3>

    <div class="BildeTekst">
      Considered the symbol of Athens and Greece, and indeed of Western civilization, the Acropolis 
      is a rocky mound rising in the heart of modern Athens, crowned by three magnificent temples dating 
      from the 5th century BC. The best known and most distinctive is the Parthenon, originally made up of 
      58 columns supporting a roof and decorated by ornate pediments and a frieze. Although the Parthenon steals the 
      show, other highlights on the Acropolis hilltop are also spectacular. The ornate Temple of Athena Nike, the Porch 
      of the Caryatids, and the Propylaea are not to be missed. Tear yourself away from the historic sights and wander over 
      to the edge, panoramic views of the seven historical hills of Athens and the city are laid out below you. Skirting the foot 
      of the Acropolis and connecting it to the city's other major ancient attractions — the Ancient Agora , the Roman Forum, 
      Kerameikos, and the Temple of Olympian Zeus — is a 2.5-kilometer walking path known as the Archaeological Promenade.

    <div class="TekstBilde">
      The massive island of Crete is one of the most popular vacation destinations in Greece. Blessed with some of the best beaches
       in Greece, the island draws visitors from around the world. Some of the most popular beaches on Crete range from small arcs of sand 
       backed by restaurants and promenades to wide-open natural stretches lapped by incredibly clear waters and endless views across the sea.
       But Crete is not all about beaches. It has its fair share of notable archeological sites, including the impressive Palace of Knossos, 
       located near the pleasant city of Heraklion. The historical city of Chania and the laid-back town of Agios Nikolaos have wonderful old waterfront 
       areas perfect for spending long afternoons on a café terrace getting lost in the views.
    </div>

    <div class="CorfuTekst">
      One of Greece's top tourist destinations, Corfu sits in the Ionian Sea off the west coast of the mainland. The capital, Corfu Town, is a UNESCO World 
      Heritage site, thanks to its elegant Italianate architecture — it was ruled by the Venetians for several centuries. Explore its romantic pedestrian-only 
      streets to discover two 16th-century fortresses and the arcaded Liston, lined by old-fashioned cafes.
      Away from the main town, the island is lushly beautiful, with rugged limestone rocks tumbling into the sea in its north and velvety green hills in 
      its south. The most popular beach area is Paleokastritsa, on the west coast, about 25 kilometers from Corfu Town. Here, you'll find a collection of deep, 
      curving bays sheltering sand and pebble beaches stretching into a clear blue sea. Corfu is served by an airport and ferries from Igoumenitsa and Patras on the
       Greek mainland. In summer, ferries sailing from Ancona and Venice also stop here.

    <div class="RhodesTekst">
      Lying on the Aegean Sea, close to Turkey, Rhodes is the largest of the Dodecanese islands. Its capital, UNESCO-listed Rhodes Town, is one of Greece's top tourist
       destinations. It is enclosed by an impressive fortification system, including monumental towers and gates built by the Knights of St. John after they took control 
       of the island in the 14th century. The car-free cobbled streets of the old town are a joy to explore on foot. Nearby attractions include the pretty hillside coastal town of Lindos, 
       and Marmaris on the Turkish coast, which can be visited by excursion boat. Rhodes is served by an airport, as well as regular ferries from Athens' port, Piraeus.
